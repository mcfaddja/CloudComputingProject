\section{Introduction}

Initially, we were going to do a software/systems comparison, with the software/systems chosen for comparison in this project being two different NoSQL database system.  These systems would have been deployed/run/operated in several different ways, including \emph{SaaS}\footnote{\textbf{SaaS :} Software as a service.} implementations, \emph{containerized} implementations, and \emph{native installations}.  The goal of the project would have been to understand the performance characteristics of each deployment method \emph{\textbf{and}} to quantify the costs of each deployment method, with the costs being calculated based on the hourly cost to operate, the initial time \& costs required for setup, and the maintenance requirement of a deployment.  Additionally, performance of the systems and deployments would have been measured using the time required to carry out various database operations, under a set of several different conditions, as well as the CPU, memory, and network loads imposed by the various deployments under the same set of conditions. As we proceeded with the project, however, we discovered that this approach was too complex and had too broad a scope.

\subsection{Changed Questions}

Ultimately, we decided that our initial approach was too complex and beyond the intended scope of the project.  Therefore, were limited ourselves to comparing DynamoDB from AWS and BigTable from Google's Cloud Services.  Unfortunately, BigTable is difficult to deploy for even a simple test case so we were again forced to alter our plan, this time by swapping BigTable for CosmosDB from Azure.
